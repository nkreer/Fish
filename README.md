## Plugins

Fish was designed with plugins in mind.
Using Fish's very simple plugin API, you can extend the software to your needs.
You can find a small tutorial on plugins [here](http://nkreer.github.io/Fish).
We aim to provide backwards-compatibility for all plugins throughout all minor releases.
